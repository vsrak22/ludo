  - `Player` - Player information and pieces
  - `GameState` - Overall game state
  - `DiceRoll` - Dice roll information
  - `BoardPosition` - Board position types
  - `Move` - Game move structure
  - `GameAction` - All possible game actions

- [x] **Game Constants**
  - Board dimensions (32x32)
  - Player colors and names
  - Starting positions for all players
  - Entry positions for each player
  - Safe zones and regular spots
  - Second and third square positions
  - Moksha position
  - Dice rules for both standard and Indian dice
  - Game rules and mechanics

### Basic UI Components

  - Game status display
  - Basic game controls (roll dice, end turn)
  - Player information panels

- [x] **Main App Component**
  - GameProvider wrapper
  - Conditional rendering based on game phase
  - Clean application structure

### Utility Functions and Hooks
- [x] **Game Utilities**
  - Position validation
  - Safe zone detection
  - Home area checking
  - Piece collision detection
  - Distance calculations
  - Game state helpers

- [x] **Custom Game Logic Hook**
  - Piece movement validation
  - Turn management
  - Game state queries
  - Action helpers
  - Comprehensive game logic encapsulation

### Documentation
- [x] **Project README**
  - Comprehensive project documentation
  - Game rules explanation
  - Setup instructions
  - Project structure overview
  - Development status tracking

## 🎯 Current Application State

The application now has:
1. **Functional Setup Screen** - Players can configure the game
2. **Basic Game Board** - 32x32 grid with player pieces
3. **Game State Management** - Complete state system ready for game logic
4. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript implementation
5. **Modern UI** - Professional styling with styled-components
6. **Extensible Architecture** - Ready for Phase 2 implementation

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is now solid and ready for Phase 2: Game Board Implementation, which will include:
- Complete board layout with all three squares
- Safe zones and regular spots rendering
- Proper piece positioning and movement paths
- Enhanced visual design

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Styled-components
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Build System**: Create React App
- **Code Quality**: ESLint configured, TypeScript strict mode
- **Performance**: Optimized build with gzip compression
